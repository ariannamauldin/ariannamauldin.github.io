        Hello, I am Arianna Mauldin. I am a current English major at the University of California Riverside. I am a current first year, located at the A-I dorms. Some interesting facts about myself are that I love helping others. This is why some of my current experience includes volunteering to read to first graders. As well as I would help them sound out their words and form basic sentences. I have also worked with middle schoolers, this was a very interesting experience; I would help them come up with essay concepts. I would also teach them more in depth grammar and spelling punctuation. On other days I was overlooking essays and explaining how they could word their sentences a bit more formal. I have also worked in a library; usually my days consisted of organizing books or helping people find a book they need as well as recommend some of my favorite books. I would also organize events such as poetry night, book drives, and book club nights. I believe this demonstrates my ability to organize in a successful and timely matter. More on a background of me I want to become an English teacher, this is why I try to involve my mainly in the English field. My biggest strengths are reading, writing, and teaching others. My main goal with teaching is making a positive influence on other peoples lives. Growing up I have always enjoyed all my encounters with my English teachers, they were always so supportive. Whenever I was having trouble coming up with essay topics or beginning to experience writers block; they always would be there for me. Typically in school I would feel like an outsider in many of my school subjects; English never felt like that though. I always knew I had a connection with English but I never realized how deep my love for it was. I had also never realized I was good at the subject until in 8th grade my teacher handed me a paper labeled "gifted English." My English teacher helped me realize this was a career I had wanted to pursue in the future.   <br><br>

        Hoping to become an English Teacher
